# Larkin Plugins for Claude Code

My (John Larkin) custom plugins for Claude Code.

There's a bit of WIP / flexibility here (like I have a specific excalidraw plugin, but then a more specific) `diagram-code` plugin. I have been wanting to bundle up all of this (so it's easier to setup on new computers / share with peers, etc) for awhile now.

Some people have bundled up all the skills as a single plugin. I do not like that approach given I think skills are light enough that you should just clone the repo, or copy the actual dir into your own `~/.claude/skills` dir. I have yet to figure out how the `.skill` files are going to be shared and imported, but excited for that.

# Installation

## Plugins

Mostly I imagine people are going to be going the `plugin` marketplace route. So you'll do something like this:

```bash
$ claude

/plugin marketplace add johnlarkin1/claude-code-extensions

# Now you're good to install what you want, probably through the interactive window.

# Some example installs:
/plugin install tauri-dev@larkin-plugins
/plugin install excalidraw-diagrams@diagram-market
/plugin install manim-animations@animation-lab
/plugin install textual-tui@ui-helpers
```

Example screenshots:

## Skills

I'd say rip the copy and paste method after cloning.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:johnlarkin1/claude-code-extensions.git
$ cd claude-code-extensions
$ cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/ # or pick and choose your own individual ones
```

## Commands

```bash
cp commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
```
